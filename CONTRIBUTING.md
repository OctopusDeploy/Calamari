# Contributing to Calamari

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Calamari!

At the moment, we do not actively monitor for issues or PRs raised by external contributors to this repository. 
While we plan to revisit this in the near future, for now, if you raise an issue or PR here it will most likely be closed or not get a reply at all. 

Instead, if you've found a bug or something isn't working, please get in touch with [our support team](https://octopus.com/support). We can probably help to find a workaround or make sure the issue gets prioritized properly.

If you have a suggestion or a feature request, again, please get in touch with [our support team](https://octopus.com/support). We'd love to hear from you!
