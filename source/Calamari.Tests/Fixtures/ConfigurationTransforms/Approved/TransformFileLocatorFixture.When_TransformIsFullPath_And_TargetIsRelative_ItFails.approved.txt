Not supported: Applying a transform with an absolute path to target in a different directory
Given a package which has the structure:
Acme.Core.1.0.0.nupkg
└─config
  └─web.config
And the following files exist:
c:\
└─transforms
  └─web.mytransform.config
Then the transform c:\transforms\web.mytransform.config => config\web.config will do nothing.
